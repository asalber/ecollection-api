{"name":"E-Collections Ontology API","tagline":"A Java Application Programming Interface for the E-Collections ontology","body":"E-Collections API is the official Java application programming interface for the [E-Collections ontology](http://aprendeconalf.es/ecollections/).\r\n\r\nThis API provides Java interfaces for every type of collection of the E-Collections ontology using the same collections taxonomy defined in the ontology. \r\nFor every collection type, the corresponding interface define the typical accessor methods (getters and setters) and methods for common operations like for example the collection cardinality, the frequency of an element, the union, intersection and complement of collections, etc. \r\nThe list of all methods for every collection is available in the Javadoc documentation. \r\n\r\nThis API also implements classes for every type of collections using the [Apache Jena ontology API](https://jena.apache.org), but it's possible to use other APIs like the [OWL API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) to implement the interfaces. \r\n\r\n## Author\r\nAlfredo SÃ¡nchez Alberca ([asalber@ceu.es](mailto:asalber@ceu.es))\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nE-Collections API is released under Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Creative Commons license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
